The main aim of the project is to develop a chat application on the android platform
using the PubNub API to handle the back-end communication. More features will only be 
added once the basic chat functionality has been achieved.

Most of the GUI has been implemented and now the focus has shifted to handling the communication behind the scenes.
Credit will be given to all developers who contribute to this project and maybe an addition to the developers resume.

For developers, the free version of the API only supports a maximum of 20 users per month.
Enjoy!
